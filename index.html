<article>

<p>
IT is the very essence of the modern world, from home-based micro businesses on Etsy or eBay up to corporations on the international stage. Technology is the synapses of economy. Every company no matter how big or small has a website, half a dozen social media accounts, and probably it’s own email server. If the company is of a decent size it could have dozens of internally used software programs to do everything from payroll and invoices, to stock management, human resources, department communications, security protocols, group organisation and calendars.
<br><br>
Multinationals could not function without the ability to correspond instantly between employees all over the planet, advertising firms are heavily invested in social media and digital formats to appeal to a contemporary audience and even the freelance craftsman relies on digital platforms to secure customers and get their name out into the public eye. We are long past the point whether it is debatable, IT is here to stay and the economic digital arms race is shaping up to be never ending.

<article>
        <img src="img2.jpg" class="imagecentre" width="550" height="400">

<p>
Digital literacy is fast becoming the most sought after skill by employers, as new generations age into the job market digital natives such as those under 30 have a huge advantage over older generations. Being able to think naturally in a digital space is its own skill and as the world commerce becomes increasingly more digitized the need for people who can fly in a digital workspace far outstrips the supply in an ever widening IT gap that might not be closed for several decades. Understanding how to build and retain engagement in digital platforms, through emails, social media, viral marketing, b/vlogging, streaming or a multitude of bleeding edge technologies will, I feel become one of the most important things a company has to contend with. 
</p>
<p>
However this still relies on more traditional roles to achieve, you cannot build engagement if you have no content, writers, artists and creatives across the spectrum will still be in high demand as long as they can channel their creativity to a digital market place.

I found Trello invaluable when working on the team project, but when working solo I found it unnecessarily slow compared to other methods of organisation.  For this project I used it to draft out my plans and tried the ‘Kanban’ method for this project. But as someone who has spent over a decade freelancing I have some very set methods of working when working solo that flows well with my thought processes. I think trello slowed me down, it was annoying to load on the low powered wifi in the college, the app uses quite a bit of memory on my phone and the login process is annoying when moving onto a new device. I then had to shuffle around and edit every single card after I’d done a few hours work, this took a lot more time than usual. I’d definitely use it again for any group project, but for solo work I have better refined processes. The ‘Kanban’ method however was quite useful and I will definitely use that again. 
<br><br>
Normally I would have set up a google docs that is automatically linked to my various google accounts and all my devices. I can invite other people to edit it if necessary. Then use a colour coding system to organise what needs doing and when. I type everything that needs doing in black, if something gets done it get changed to red, if something becomes urgent it becomes yellow, if something is waiting for supplies or other prerequisites to be delivered before it can be actioned it becomes blue, then when the prerequisite item comes it gets switched to black or yellow depending if it’s urgent or not. If you do a long day of work all you need to do is highlight the bullet points you have completed and turn them all to red with one click, which is a lot faster than trello was.
<br><br>
I understand you can do similar stuff with the colour tags in trello, but it just seemed a lot more clunky to manipulate especially on mobile. However I would definitely be willing to use trello for group porjects in future.

Mostly Photoshop, illustrator and InDesign. If you want to work in the industry these are the basic tools of your trade. An interior decorator can’t decide he’s suddenly never going to use paint again and only work in wallpaper; he won’t get enough business to survive because wallpaper is nowhere near as popular.

<h2 class="centre">1.6 How my chosen technology achieves my outcome</h2>
<article>
        <img src="img6.jpg" class="imagecentre" width="550" height="400">
<p>
This is an interesting question to answer because my technologies were chosen for me by the course. 
<br><br>
It’s been enjoyable learning new software and methods that function as creative outlets. Python is a very fluid back end language that I’ve greatly enjoyed figuring out. It’s obviously got a lot to offer and I look forward to keep working on it. The group project with it was a very enjoyable collaboration, I’m very proud of the game we created and my team was awesome to work with. Trello came in very handy with this project, it kept everyone easily organised and on the same page throughout. We did about 95% of the coding all sat at the same table, but I think if we’d been across different offices or buildings it would have been even more useful. It’s obviously a very powerful tool for group projects.
<br><br>
This website has been coded in HTML5 and CSS. I’ve found HTML5 to be a very intuitive language and very very easy to work with for most things. CSS is very well created as well and so easy to integrate the two languages it’s almost like writing in one. 

Program wise I love IDLE for coding python. I downloaded a few code writing programs on my personal laptop, but ended up using IDLE. It’s quick, simplistic and just lets you open up and code well. It’s got enough features to be helpful when you mistype, but not enough they get in the way.
<br><br>
Visual Studio Code is also very good in my opinion. I didn’t try any other html editors because I didn’t feel the need to. I’ve used online editors before and they aren’t as good. Again like IDLE it has some really useful features such as autowrapping, file suggestions and tag suggestions, but doesn’t get in the way.
<br><br>
Git and Github. Git is an opensource project started by the guy who created Linux, it’s part social media for programmers part code library. It allows you to store, create and share codes. It has dozens of features, but the best in my opinion is the ability to store branches of different code. It lets you have loads of different versions of a code you are working on so you can try various builds to experiment.

<h2 class="centre">1.7 Legality and constraints in digital landscapes</h2>
<article>
        <img src="img7.jpg" class="imagecentre" width="550" height="400">
        <p>
                The law surrounding digital practices is incredibly intricate and complex with each country or major region having its own idea of what is and isn’t allowed in their territory. Europe and the UK have very stringent laws about data protection, data collection and freedom of information. Not to mention the minefields that are the out-dated and inefficient copyright laws in a world of unlimited hosting, countless platforms, instant sharing and lightning speed, fluid social media. 
                <br><br>
                On the international stage, businesses dedicate entire departments of lawyers and digital experts to navigating the various laws and processes of performing in a digital space in the bounds of a specific territory. China is the most notable example of this, with Hollywood films and multinational games developers often censoring their own products to get past Chinese sensors. The buying power of the country is too big to discount off hand and companies may go to extreme lengths to appease the stringent and aggressive demands of the Chinese government, often putting themselves in no win situations.
                <br><br>
                The best example of this is the Blizzard fiasco of October 2019. In the third month of Honk Kong freedom protests, the Hearthstone (a spotlight blizzard game) Grandmasters (their flagship tournament) winner Blitzchung used his acceptance speech to draw attention to the plight of the protesters in Hong Kong.  Blizzard cut the stream, banned him from competing, rescinded his prize money and even went as far as firing the two shoutcasters (eSports commentators) who were interviewing him. The backlash was immediate, at time of writing thousands of people have deleted their blizzard accounts and there is a boycott underway, they have had large staff walkouts and are stuck between their western audience who value free speech and the Chinese sensors. Whatever they do they risk loosing a financially significant amount of their player base. 
                <br><br>
                Interestingly the disenchanted player base has started to try and get Blizzard banned in china anyway by taking one of the main characters from Overwatch (their current flagship eSport) who is Chinese and depicting her in Hong Kong flags wearing the masks and iconography that is common to the anti-Chinese protesters. If this attempt to turn her into an icon of anti-Chinese rebellion is successful and China adds the character Mei to their list of banned symbols (along with Winnie the Pooh and other fictional characters), Blizzard could face their biggest game being banned in China anyway or have to remove one of the most loved and profitable characters from their biggest game. Either way they will still be loosing massive credibility with their western audience. They’ve really stepped on a digital landmine with this one and as someone who has previously been heavily invested in some of their properties it will be fascinating to watch it unfold. 
                <br><br>
                So far Blizzards only response was a tweet apologising for “damaging the dignity of the Chinese people.” And they have disabled the ability to delete your account, now while this does mean they won’t take a huge hit to subscriber amounts when they have to report to their shareholders, many people are pointing out it could very well violate the GDPR in European territories because of laws about data protection and deletion as well as violating some of their own terms and conditions that are signed when a client downloads, purchases or installs one of their products. This could leave them open to class action law suits in Europe and possibly elsewhere.  Some people have been getting around this inability to delete their accounts in protest by forcing Blizzard to ban their account by creating aggressively pro Hong Kong and free speech and anti Blizzard and China posts on the official Blizzard message boards and social media.
                <br><br>
                Other companies have been quick to jump on the bandwagon however, with Redbull releasing a pro Hong Kong advert less than 24 hours after this hit news headlines and several rival gaming companies tweeting support of free speech and one smaller company who make a rival card game to Hearthstone called “Gods Unchained” have been successful at stealing some spotlight by offering to cover the prize money of the Hearthstone player that started it all and job offers for the two newly fired shoutcasters.
                <br><br>
                As of time of writing this whole thing happened three days ago and the situation has become so well reported that American senators from both the Republicans and the Democrats have publicly denounced Blizzards kowtowing to Chinese censorship. Blizzards stock has dropped 4 points this week.
                <br><br>
                This is obviously an extreme example, but within the current digital landscape even the smallest action can snowball into the hugest political or legal nightmare for a business.
                <br><br>
                Update: It's been three days which is an eternity in the world of the internet, Blizzard caved and gave Blitzchung his prize money but kept him banned for six months down from twelve. The shoutcasters are still fired and Blizzards number one caster has resigned in protest. They looked like they were on full damage control, but then released a statement saying anyone found at Blizzcon with any winnie the pooh merchandise at the end of the month, will be escorted off the premesis, Winnie the Pooh being a banned character in China due to the memes making fun of Xi Jinping for looking like said bear. One meme had been trying to get people to turn up in Winnie the Pooh cosplay as a protest, this crackdown has just reignited the fire bigger than ever. One step forwards, two backwards seems to be Blizzards plan for this issue.
                <br><br>
                In related news the NBA lost millions in sponsorship this morning from Chinese companies pulling out of deals because of a tweet from one coach of one team. You have to wonder if making billion dollar business deals with China is worth it for companies if they can be completely torn down with a single tweet from one minor person in your business. Will markets have to choose between the east or west in future? The western audience seems to be rightiously against China's totalitarian government and mass human rights violations. Can a business bridge the gap and win both sides or are all these attempts to break into the Chinese market a lose/lose eventuality? Time will tell.

                I decided to start off with a simple homepage to make accessing my answers easy as possible. I broke each question up into a box and added a cool parallax scroll feature just to see if I could because it wasn’t easy to code. Overall it came out really well and I’m quite happy with it. The info is easy to read and access which was the main point of this website.

                <br>
                I wanted to try making a portfolio gallery, as that is a thing that is very useful to me personally. I kept it a simple white background with no distracting features. A small description of each piece underneath and a title was all that is needed. Making the grid, the columns, rows and arranging it all was probably the hardest part of the HTML/CSS module. This page took probably about 40% of all the time I spent on this website. I used Photoshop to edit the images to suit the page better.

I really respect clean and minimalist design in digital spaces. A blogs primary function is getting information across and I like to keep that aspect to the front. I don’t want tons of fancy fonts, gimmicky gifs or distracting displays. I’ve gone for a contemporary ever-scroll style display because 55% of all internet traffic comes from smart phones and it’s a proven way to up engagement. I’ve kept everything else clear and professional with a minimum of anything other than the most necessary features. This isn’t me trying to avoid coding, I have a degree in illustration and graphic design and place a point of pride in functionality coupled with sleek design when I make anything. I really hate any type of clutter that distracts from the purpose of the piece. This is about communicating information, so I have kept to that strictly.

        <p>
                I've didn't feel it was necessary to include a lot of features or gimmicks. Some of my friends on the course have included little Easter eggs, tons of irrelevant images or other random bits. But none of that fit in with the minimalist design ethos I chose for this particular project. I feel I've shown enough to show I understand how HTML and CSS work. Mouse over icons, music, little videos and the like are all cute, and if I was making a personal blog I would have taken a different design route for my visual style. But I'm here to learn coding not do even more graphic design, so I selected a clean minimalist style with a comics subtheme that gets the relevant information across easily. Although I did indulge in pixel painting and adding a cute little favicon.

                I included some styled buttons at the top because they were necessary and I wanted them to look nice if I was gonna include them. I chose a parallax scroll because it's a bit of a challenge to code and I wanted to see if I could, I also like the effect. Although if I was doing it again I'd probably have chosen a different image for the background, maybe make a custom one. I kept the questions in styled boxes for clarity's sake and neatness. All the images I used are either open source stock images or images I have created myself. 
                <br><br>
                I used an external style sheet so I could keep all four pages consistent. This allows me to set boxes, fonts, backgrounds etc all to one colour for the entire site with just a few keystrokes.

<p>
In the UK: You get the copyright of any work of creation from moment of creation, this includes everything that could be considered a work of creative practice and has legal precedence to include website layouts and design. You don’t need to add any copyright notice to have your work protected but it is common practice to the copyright symbol (©), your name and the year of creation. This also means you cannot copy others works without permission, however there are exceptions for reasons like non-commercial research, parody, criticism, reviews, reporting current events and more.
<br><br>
In the US: Works are copyrighted from the moment of creation despite the format of publication or mediums used as long as it is fixed in a tangible form – published some how. You don’t need to claim a copyright for it to be in effect (the law eliminated public notice in 1989). They also use the (©) symbol.

                There are literally dozens of appropriate file types depending on what you need to do. For images .jpg is the standard, but .png is great if you want a transparent background, .gif allows you to make moving images that act like pseudo videos. For music and video .mp3 and .mp4 are great respectively. For coding .html and .css are the bulk of front end internet pages. You want .exe for downloading and transferring runnable programs on windows devices. .pdf is standard for documents and very easy to access. .rar and .zip are for compressing large files into more manageable file sizes. 
                
                Picking the right file type is vital, but there are dozens and dozens of common file types and they all have different applications.

<h2 class="centre">1.2.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively</h2>
<article>
        <img src="img16.jpg" class="imagecentre" width="550" height="400">
        <p>
                Firstly you should always zip your large files. What counts as a large file is pretty subjective but if it takes more than about a minute to upload/download then I'd definitely compress it with a .zip or .rar depending on where I plan on sending it.
                
                The method of file storage really depends on the sensitivity of the documents involved. Cloud storage is great for most day to day options, and most devices have automatic compression features that just work in the background. These can then be shared, accessed and viewed by you or anyone with an internet connection you share the link and password to. However the cloud is not a safe method of storage, you never know for sure by who or where your data is being hosted. There are entire un-indexed websites (darkweb) that are dedicated in trading files found from compromised cloud accounts. Wikileaks is by far the biggest repository of leaked documents from many different sources, quite a number are dredged from compromised cloud accounts. In 2014 dozens of high profile and A-list Hollywood actresses had their nudes leaked, it made international news and was traced back to compromised iCloud accounts. So the cloud is great, but don't put anything up you wouldn't post on your facebook.
                
                I am personally partial to just emailing stuff to my own email, it means I can log on anywhere and just search my inbox for the relevant email and I can download those files to any device. If you just want free storage of small images and files then this is an alright way of doing it.
                
                For more secure options there are paid for encrypted storage sites that function similar to the cloud but are more secure. However anything on the internet could in theory be accessed by someone determined enough. But for really confidential files I'd password encrypt it if it had to be sent via the internet, or possibly just keep it on a external hard drive or thumb drive, keep it physically with you or somewhere locked safe.

Yeah I’m happy with the tools I’ve been given mostly. As I said before VSC is a sweet program, it’s got great features and I’ve not explored it fully yet. Github is pretty cool, I think this project is a little small for getting the most of the branches but on bigger more long term projects it would be invaluable. Trello I’ve already reviewed above quite a bit, it’s good, but not great for solo projects. Although some of that limitation might be due to local circumstances (slow wifi at college).

Again this feels like a question I’ve answered before, so I’ll keep it brief. VSC is super useful for coding HTML/CSS and is by far one of the nicest coding tools I’ve encountered in my limited experience. Trello is an appropriate tool, but I didn’t personally get on with it. There are a hundreds of theories and tools to help you plan projects, Trello is good at what it does but it’s designed for teams.

                I think having only a few days coding with HTML/CSS under my belt I'd say my website is a complete success. It has all the info, it has a few flexes like some complex scrolling, a fancy portfolio, a favicon. It fits in with the minimalist ideals I chose early on. I'm really happy with it given the time scale and knowledge base I've created it with. I think if I had more time I'd spend more time on some better backgrounds. I would have whipped some up but don't have my drawing tablet at college so that limits my photo editing abilities quite heavily. If I wanted to keep this website for future use as a portfolio I'd definitely spend a ton more time on personalising it and polishing it. I'd delete these sections and write up something that looked more like a professional blog.

        Well if this was a portfolio website, I'd link it to my social media accounts, set up a shop for some prints and merchandise. I'd have a much larger portfolio section, split it into 2d design, costume & props, clothing designs etc. I've only included a few place holder images of stuff I've made in the last few months in this draft of the website. Some of the bits I've put up aren't good enough for a final professional portfolio, they were just well edited for this project so do the job.

                I've got a website, it's made with HTML and a separate CSS stylesheet. I've answered all these questions in the form of blog posts. I've included a bunch of styling and solid working html. I've included some referencing where appropriate and made a trello board. I feel like I've met all the requirements of this brief.

                I don't think I could have been much more efficient in terms of coding, but you don't know what you don't know. And I've only just began to learn the tools. I think I've laid out the code well enough, I find it highly readable and well split up with div tags. My CSS sheet is fully functional and also well laid out as far as I can tell, but maybe with more experience in future I will look back and feel differently. 
                <br><br>
                The tools I used were perfectly functional and allowed me to just sit and work which is what I always look for in any sort of medium. Doesn't matter if I'm painting a canvas, working in a photo editing program, sculpting or coding. If I'm being creative the medium must not get in the way of my ability to manipulate it intuitively. And the programs I've used here on this course have been great for that. 
                <br><br>
                I definitely could have done this in a team, it would have meant we could have got a lot more stuff. Maybe made it a bit stronger overall. Gone into more detail in the aesthetics of the site.

<h2 class="centre">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<article>
        <img src="img24.jpg" class="imagecentre" width="550" height="400">
        <p>
                Honestly, I think the hardest thing in terms of productivity for me on this course has been my commute. I travel over two hours each way, this means across the three weeks I've been getting slowly more and more run down. Early starts and late homecomings have really eaten into my ability to practice at home or do much more than eat, relax for a couple of hours and sleep when I've gotten home. The fact my commute is split up across several public transport elements with long walks in between and mostly no wifi means I can't even get my laptop out and code on the tram/bus/train. So I've lost a lot of productivity compared to some of my fellow students who can drive home in 20 minutes or so.
                <br><br>
                On the flip side I've learned the Kanban method which is cool, it's a good way to organise stuff and one I will be incorporating into many more of my future projects and creative processes in future. It is similar to how I've worked before but I've used colour coded tags instead of a board where I physically move the tasks across. So that's definitely an improvement in efficiency for me.
                <br><br>
                I will be considering trello for future collaborations, especially with artists who aren't local to the studio I'm working out of. Really snazzy little tool for my box. 
                <br><br>
                Then of course there is efficiency in the code itself. External style sheets are the most efficient way to work with CSS and HTML5 together. The one or two times I've done HTML in the past, it's mostly been for small one shot email advertisements as a graphic designer. I didn't know about external style sheets and it's so so so much more efficient than the inline method I was using before. 
                <br><br>
                Another way to ensure productivity in coding is that you make good use of best practices wherever possible. This means you avoid 'Spaghetti code' and can collaborate with other coders. This was very important on the group project because we were all editing the same code at once and making weird changes all over the shop, so we agreed on certain styles of coding we would all conform to and used a lot of comments to create our game.

                I'd make a mockup of how I wanted the website to look, then find exactly the right code I needed to make that happen. This time I mostly winged it one bit of code at a time. Like, I decided I wanted all the questions to be easily scrollable from the main page, so I worked out how to do that. Then I wanted them in boxes so I did that. Then I wanted to change the colour. Then line type of the boxes so did that. Then I changed the corners. Each little change was researched individually and tested thoroughly as I applied it. I think I'd find more complete solutions to write next time from the beginning. But it's all a learning curve and I'm so happy with what I've learnt on this course, I have a lot of confidence in the ability to work out any problem now given enough time. I feel like I could probably self teach myself a lot more if I wanted to and had the time.

        <p>
                I'm not quite sure if this question refers to me testing new digital solutions that work for me, or how I would test digital solutions I've created so I'm gonna answer both interpretations of the question. 
                <br><br>
                1. Since I started this course I have spent a lot of time looking into and researching various different types of programs, software, languages and hardware. Generally just updating my knowledge of technology and digital tools. I've been playing about with apps that teach coding, teaching websites that give you coding challenges such as "code something that does x", reading articles reviewing and assessing contemporary coding knowledge and general technology news. I'd test these solutions by reading reviews and downloading several competing products to find the one that works best for me.
                <br><br>
                2. To test digital solutions eg. this website. I've run it in several browsers, on different operating systems (windows & mac) and I've run it on mobile devices. I've made sure I get consistent results in each browser (that all info shows up in an aesthetically pleasing manner).
