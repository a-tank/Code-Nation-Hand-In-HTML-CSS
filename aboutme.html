<h1 class="centre">About Me</h1>
<p> 
<br>
Alden has been working as a freelance creative artist and problem solver since 2010, he has collaborated with dozens of brands and artists during this time. 
<br>
<br>
He has developed a wide skill set from such varied mediums as traditional painting techniques, leatherworking, digital art, sculpture, coding, interior decorating and more. Alden finds the tradition of artists writing their own profiles in third person very strange. 
<br>
<br>
Alden honed his abilitites with a degree from the University for Creative Arts, the number one ranked creative university in Britain, he got a BA with Honours in Illustration, graduating in 2017.
<br>
He has worked in many roles as a maker and problem solver. He's been published as a comic book artist several times, made props and costumes for film, tv and theatre. He's worked as a clothing designer collaborating with several alternative lables, was an interior designer for Ikea show rooms, worked with several high profile bands for logo and poster designs and is currently learning coding so he can blend his artistic skills with a digital medium. 
<br>
<br>
In his personal life he enjoys both watching and playing ice hockey, he plays as goal tender for small local teams. He enjoys lrping due to the costume challenges envolved. He's been known to listen to a wide range of music, but you will mostly find him singing along to punk anthems as he works, he can play electric bass and aucoustic ukelele, "If it's got mroe than four strings it's not worth it." is his motto. Although his favourite pastime is taking his shar-pei Ripley for walks down by the river Irwell at sunset.
